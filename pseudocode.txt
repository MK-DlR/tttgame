PROJECT
1. create objects
    1a. create a Gameboard object
        - to store the gameboard (as an array) inside of
    Done
    1b. players will also be stored in objects
    Done
    1c. controlling the flow of the game itself also requires an object
    Wip
    1d. have as little global code as possible
        - put as much as possible within factories
        - if only a single instance is needed (gameboard, displayController, etc)
            - wrap the factory inside an IIFE
    1e. all functionality should fit in the
        - game object
        - player objects
        - gameboard object
        - think carefully about where all logic should go
        - resource: https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out

2. focus on getting a working game in the console first
    2a. make sure to include logic to check for when game is over
        - check for all winning 3-in-a-rows and ties
        - avoid worrying about 
            - DOM and HTML/CSS until game is working
            - user input until game is working

3. once the game works in the console
    3a. create an object
        - that will handle the display/DOM logic
    3b. write a function that renders contents of the gameboard array
        - to the webpage
        - can fill in with dummy x's and o's to see what's going on

4. write the functions that allow players
    4a. to mark specific spot/s on the board
        - by interacting with appropriate DOM elements
            - ie: click on a board square to place marker
        - don't forget logic that keeps players from playing in taken spots

5. clean up interface
    5a. to allow players to put in their names
    5b. include a button to start/restart game
    5c. add a display element that shows the results on game end
